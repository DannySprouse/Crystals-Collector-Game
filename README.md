Crystals Collector Game

This is a simple game built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and JQuery. 

The computer generates a random number, which is visible to the player.  There are four crystal images that also each get assigned a random number, and these numbers are not visible to the player.  The objective is to click on the four crystal images to reveal their value and attempt to generate a value equal to the computer generated number.  If there is an exact match, the player wins and a Win score is added; if the player exceeds the target number, the player loses and a Losses score is added.  After a win or loss, the game resets, and a new random number target is set for the player, and all four crystal images also receive additional randomly assigned numbers.
